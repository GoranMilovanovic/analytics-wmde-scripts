social irc
====================

This shows the number of users currently in the #wikidata irc channel on freenode.
This metric is generated using a regex match on the ircindexer.net service.

If this service stops working there are alternatives.
Another alternative would be to make the script actually join the channel to perform the check.

This metric probably heavily depends on the time that it is taken (currently once daily).
